# Poetic Playbook

This book is our guide. It is filled with the knowledge of current and past Poets. We encourage you to read it, question it, and improve it as you gain experience that is beneficial to the team.

Our playbook is open source in hopes that others will learn from our experiences. We also do this in the spirit of transparency to our clients so they can see how we strive to operate.

## Principles

A Poet seeks achievement and personal development inside and outside of work. Stagnant water goes stale; flowing water is pure; water that flows too quickly can be dangerous. We seek a constant and balanced flow.
